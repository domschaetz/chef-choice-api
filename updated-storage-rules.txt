// The issue was that the original rules expected:
// recipes/{userId}/{filename} 
// 
// But actual upload paths are:
// recipes/{filename}

// This simplified rule allows any authenticated user to access any recipe image,
// which is appropriate since all users should be able to see recipe images.
